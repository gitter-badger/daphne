Daphne is a programming-language, worth of trying. It has a lot of features, here are some of them.

- Compact and lightweight implementation
- Big standard library and additional modules
- Namespaces through classes (**inherited from Newspeak**)
- Modules through classes (**inherited from Newspeak**)
- Powerful and intuitive syntax inspired heavily by Smalltak, Newspeak amd others
