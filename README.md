# The Daphne programming-language

An innovative programming-language with a functional touch, running on jvm **wip**

## Introduction 

The Daphne programming-language is a functional, quasi-dynamic programming language based heavily on other languages such as **Smalltalk,
Newspeak, Io, R, Erlang and Java**. Daphne serves an intuitive syntax, as absolute control of functionality. It features an open type-system, the ability to compile to bytecode and many many more...

## Features:

Daphne is a programming-language, worth of trying. It has a lot of features, here are some of them.

- Compact and lightweight implementation
- Big standard library and additional modules
- Namespaces through classes (**inherited from Newspeak**)
- Modules through classes (**inherited from Newspeak**)
- Powerful and intuitive syntax inspired heavily by Smalltak, Newspeak amd others
- Functional programming
- Parallel programming within channels and fibers
- many more...

> Note: Most of it is still under early but heavy development, so don't touch it yet.

# Build Daphne from sources

## Build Daphne on Unix

For building Daphne on a Unix like OS, simply fire-up a terminal of your choice and start typing in the commands below.

```bash
# Install with Apache Maven
mvn clean install

# install from Gradle build tool
# todo
```

## Build Daphne on MacOS

If you desire to build or use Daphne on MacOS you can simpy get the pre-build binaries and build-scripts. **todo**

## Build Daphne on Windows

For Windows you simply need to get the binaries or you can run the commands from the unix section. 

> Note: You'll need to install either gradle or maven. OpenJDK 8 / 11 is recommend
